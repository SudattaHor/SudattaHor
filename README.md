# Welcome

I'm Sudatta Hor, a sophomore at Brown University studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Physics.

I'm currently conducting research with the [Rodriguez Flow Research group](https://github.com/RodriguezFlowResearch). My current project includes using numerical methods to simulate microbubble oscillations.

I enjoy computational physics, but I also have interest in getting into quantum computing research, specifically quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography.
